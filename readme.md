## About the Assignment

The goal was to design persuasive, data-driven content prompts using the AIDCA framework combined with Cialdini’s persuasion principles. The task involved:

- Engineering prompts to generate effective ad copy for different product-persona combinations  
- Analyzing mock campaign data (views and CTR) to diagnose message-market misfits  
- Iterating prompt design to improve resonance and performance  
- Summarizing strategic learnings about prompt design and campaign effectiveness

## Key Takeaways

- Effective prompt design combines structured messaging (AIDCA) with psychological persuasion (Cialdini)  
- Campaign metrics must be read as decision signals, not just numbers  
- Iterative refinement driven by data helps create messages that truly resonate with target audiences  
- AI can be a powerful co-pilot when given precise, disciplined prompts
