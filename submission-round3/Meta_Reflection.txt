## Meta-Reflection
**What role are you now ready for?**
I'm ready for a role where I combine data, content, and AI to create scalable storytelling systems — especially in early-stage creative teams.

**What surprised you about your own thinking?**
I didn’t expect to enjoy system-building. But the moment I started structuring prompts and processes, I realized that I’m not just a content creator — I’m a pattern-maker.

**What do you most want your future manager to understand about you?**
I’m not afraid of complexity — I just need context. Once I see the system, I move fast, ask better questions, and build with clarity and care.
